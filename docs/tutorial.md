Tutorial
--------

To follow along with this tutorial in an interactive Python session,
if you wish to do so, make sure you have downloaded the [demonstration
model "capacitor.mph"][demo] from this library's GitHub repository,
and saved it in the same folder from which you run Python.

It is a model of a non-ideal, inhomogeneous, parallel-plate capacitor,
in that its electrodes are of finite extent, the edges are rounded
to avoid excessive electric-field strengths, and *two* media of
different dielectric permittivity fill the separate halves of the
electrode gap. Running the model only requires a license for the core
Comsol platform, but not for any add-on module beyond that.

### Starting Comsol

In the beginning was the client. And the client was with Comsol. And
the client was Comsol. So let there be a Comsol client.
```python
>>> import mph
>>> client = mph.Client(cores=1)
```

It takes roughly ten seconds until the client is initialized. In this
example, the Comsol back-end is instructed to use only one processor
core. If the optional parameter is omitted, it will use all cores
available on the machine. Restricting this resource is useful when
running several simulations in parallel. Note, however, that due to
[limitations](limitations) of this library's underlying Python-to-Java
bridge, you cannot instantiate the [Client](api/mph.Client) class more
than once. If you wish to accomplish that, in order to realize the full
compute power of your simulation hardware, you need to start separate
Python sessions, one for each client.


### Managing models

Now that we have the client up and running, we can tell it to load a
model file.
```python
>>> model = client.load('capacitor.mph')
```

It returns a `model` object, i.e. an instance of the
[`Model`](api/mph.Model) class. We will learn what to do with it
further down. For now, it was simply loaded into memory. We can
list the names of all models the client currently manages.
```python
>>> client.names()
['capacitor']
```

If we were to load more models, that list would be longer. Note that
the above simply displays the names of the models. The actual model
objects can be recalled as follows:
```python
>>> client.models()
[<mph.model.Model object at 0x000002CAF6C0BE80>]
```

We will generally not need to bother with these lists, as we would
rather hold on to the `model` reference we received from the client.
But to free up memory, we could remove a specific model.
```python
>>> client.remove(model)
```

Or we could remove all models at once — restart from a clean slate.
```python
>>> client.clear()
>>> client.names()
[]
```


### Inspecting models

Let's have a look at the parameters defined in the model.
```python
>>> for parameter in model.parameters():
...     print(parameter)
...
parameter(name='U', value='1[V]', description='applied voltage')
parameter(name='d', value='2[mm]', description='electrode spacing')
parameter(name='l', value='10[mm]', description='plate length')
parameter(name='w', value='2[mm]', description='plate width')
```

Or the materials for that matter.
```python
>>> model.materials()
['medium 1', 'medium 2']
```

They will be used by these physics interfaces:
```python
>>> model.physics()
['electrostatic', 'electric currents']
```

To solve the model, we will run these studies:
```python
>>> model.studies()
['static', 'relaxation', 'sweep']
```

Notice something? All features are referred to by their names, also
known as labels, such as `medium 1`. But *not* by their tags, such as
`mat1`, which litter not just the Comsol programming interface, but,
depending on display settings, its graphical user interface as well.

Tags are an implementation detail. An unnecessary annoyance to anyone
who has ever scripted a Comsol model from either Matlab or Java.
Unnecessary because names/labels are equally enforced to be unique,
so tags are not needed for disambiguation. And annoying because we
cannot freely change a tag. Say, we remove a feature, but then realize
we need it after all, and thus recreate it. It may now have a different
tag. And any code that references it has to adapted.

This is Python though. We hide implementation details as much as we
can. Abstract them out. So refer to things in the model tree by what
you name them in the model tree. If you remove a feature and then put
it back in, just give it the same name, and nothing has changed. You
may also set up different models to be automated by the same script.
No problem, as long as your naming scheme is consistent throughout.


### Modifying parameters

As we have learned from the list above, the model defines a parameter
named `d` that denotes the electrode spacing. If we know a parameter's
name, we can access its value directly.

```python
>>> model.parameter('d')
'2[mm]'
```

If we pass in not just the name, but also a value, that same method
modifies it.
```python
>>> model.parameter('d', '1[mm]')
>>> model.parameter('d')
'1[mm]'
```

This particular model's only geometry sequence
```python
>>> model.geometries()
['geometry']
```
is set up to depend on that very value. So it will effectively change
the next time it is rebuilt. This will happen automatically once we
solve the model. But we may also trigger the geometry rebuild right
away.
```python
>>> model.build()
```

### Running simulations

To solve the model, we need to create a mesh. This would also be taken
care of automatically, but let's make sure this critical step passes
without a hitch.
```python
>>> model.mesh()
```

Now run the first study, the one set up to compute the electrostatic
solution, i.e. the instantaneous and purely capacitive response to the
applied voltage, before leakage currents have any time to set in.
```python
>>> model.solve('static')
```

This modest simulation should not take longer than a few seconds.
While we are at it, we may as well solve the remaining two studies,
one time-dependent, the other a parameter sweep.
```python
>>> model.solve('relaxation')
>>> model.solve('sweep')
```

They take a little longer, but not much. We could have solved all three
studies at once, or rather, all of the studies defined in the model.
```python
>>> model.solve()
```


### Evaluating results

Let's see what we found out and evaluate the electrostatic capacitance,
i.e. at zero time or infinite frequency.
```python
>>> model.evaluate('2*es.intWe/U^2', 'pF')
array(1.31947349)
```

All results are returned as NumPy arrays. Though scalars such as this
one could be readily cast to a (regular Python) `float`.

We could also ask where the electric field is strongest.
```python
>>> (x, y, E) = model.evaluate(['x', 'y', 'es.normE'])
>>> E.max()
1455.5010798501924
>>> imax = E.argmax()
>>> x[imax], y[imax]
(-0.0005161744830262844, 0.004178390490229011)
```

Note how this time we did not specify any units. When left out, values
are returned in default units. Here specifically, the maximum field
strength in V/m and its coordinates in meters.

We also did not specify the dataset, even though there are three
different studies that have separate solutions and datasets associated
along with them. When not named specifically, the default dataset is
used. That generally refers to the study defined first, here "static".
The default dataset is the one resulting from that study, here —
inconsistently — named "electrostatic".
```python
>>> model.datasets()
['electrostatic', 'time-dependent', 'parametric sweep']
```

Now let's look at the time dependence. The two media in this model
have a small, but finite conductivity, leading to leakage currents in
the long run. As the two conductivities also differ in value, charges
will accumulate at the interface between the media. This interface
charge leads to a gradual relaxation of the total capacitance over
time. We can tell that from its value at the first and last time step.
```python
>>> C = '2*ec.intWe/U^2'
>>> model.evaluate(C, 'pF', 'time-dependent', 'first')
array(1.31947349)
>>> model.evaluate(C, 'pF', 'time-dependent', 'last')
array(1.48410629)
```

The "first" and "last" time step defined in that study are 0 and 1
second, respectively.
```python
>>> (indices, values) = model.inner('time-dependent')
>>> values[0]
0.0
>>> values[-1]
1.0
```

Obviously, the capacitance also varies if we change the distance
between the electrodes. In the model, a parameter sweep was used to
study that. These "outer" solutions, just like the time-dependent
"inner" solutions, are referenced by indices, i.e. integer numbers,
each of which corresponds to a particular parameter value.
```python
>>> (indices, values) = model.outer('parametric sweep')
>>> indices
array([1, 2, 3], dtype=int32)
>>> values
array([1., 2., 3.]
>>> model.evaluate(C, 'pF', 'parametric sweep', 'first', 1)
array(1.31947349)
>>> model.evaluate(C, 'pF', 'parametric sweep', 'first', 2)
array(0.73678503)
>>> model.evaluate(C, 'pF', 'parametric sweep', 'first', 3)
array(0.52865545)
```

Then again, with a scripting interface such as this one, we may as
well run the time-dependent study a number of times and change the
parameter value from one run to the next. General parameter sweeps
can get quite complicated in terms of how they map to indices as
soon as combinations of parameters are allowed. Support for this may
therefore be dropped in a future release — while the API is still
considered unstable, which it is for as long as the version number
of this library does not start with a 1 —, just to keep things simple
and clean.


### Saving results

To save the model we just solved, along with its solution, just do:
```python
>>> model.save()
```

This would overwrite the existing file we loaded the model from. To
avoid this, we could specify a different file name.
```python
>>> model.save('capacitor_solved')
```

The `.mph` extension will be added automatically if it is not included
in the first place.

Maybe we don't actually need to keep the solution and mesh data around.
The model was quick enough to solve, and we do like free disk space.
We would just like to be able to look up modeling details somewhere
down the line. Comsol also keeps track of the modeling history: a log
of which features were created, deleted, modified, and in which order.
Typically, such details are irrelevant. We can prune them by resetting
that record.
```python
>>> model.clear()
>>> model.reset()
>>> model.save('capacitor_compacted')
```

Most functionality that the library offers is covered in this tutorial.
The few things that were left out can be gleaned from the [API
documentation](api).
