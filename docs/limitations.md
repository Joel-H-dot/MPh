Limitations
-----------

This library depends on the Python-to-Java bridge [JPype][jpype-repo].
It therefore inherits its limitation, in that only one Java virtual
machine can be managed within the same Python session, and thus only
one Comsol client. If several simulations are to be run in parallel,
distributed over independent processor cores in an effort to achieve
maximum speed-up of a parameter sweep, they have to be started as
separate Python (sub-)processes. This is a feasible work-around, but
a limitation nonetheless.

For the same reason, it seems, the [unit tests][mph-tests] that
come with MPh fail when collected and run via the testing framework
[pyTest][pytest-docs]. They must be run directly from the command
line. Since they cannot be used for continuous integration testing
anyway, given that they depend on Comsol being installed on the local
machine, this is but a minor inconvenience.

Furthermore, there are some known, but unresolved issues with JPype's
shutdown of the Java virtual machine. Most notably, pressing
<kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> to interrupt an ongoing operation will usually crash
the entire Python session. So do not rely on that to work.

There is an alternative Java bridge, [pyJNIus][jnius-repo], which is
not limited to one virtual machine, but then fails in another regard:
A number of Java methods exposed by Comsol are inexplicably missing
from the Python encapsulation.

MPh is, at this point, also limited to work on Windows only, even
though Comsol itself is available on other platforms, namely Linux
and MacOS. The code that identifies installed Comsol versions and
locates the executables has to be adapted to support the other
operating systems. This is not difficult per se, but the devil is
in the details. Contributions or even just suggestions
[on GitHub][mph-repo] are welcome.

Cross-network client–server connections, while ostensibly supported
by this library, have never actually been tested — for lack of a
network license, required for that purpose. It may work as is, or may
require transmitting login details: user name and password. File a
GitHub issue if you are in a position to test this scenario and want
the problem solved.

The API is intentionally scope-limited to automating the simulation
workflow, such as running parameter sweeps or optimization routines
with customized, Python-powered post-processing. Exposing any and all
Comsol features to create or alter every aspect of a model, and thus
replicating the entire Java API, albeit in a more pythonic way, is out
of scope.

Though users who do want to dig deeper may access the "pythonized"
Java layer directly, via the `.java` attribute of `Client` instances
(mapping to Comsol's `ModelUtil`) as well as `Model` (mapping to
Comsol's `model`). Refer to Comsol's programming manual for details.

This might even be worthwhile for Java developers of Comsol
applications, as the interactive Python prompt provides easy
introspection of the object hierarchy. In these circumstances, one
might find the convenience function `mph.inspect` helpful, as it not
only lists an object's methods in a more readable way than the
built-in `dir`, but also displays the "properties" possibly defined
on a model node.

It may equally help to call the returned Python model object something
like `pymodel` and assign the name `model` to `pymodel.java`. Then you
can just copy-and-paste Java or Matlab code from the Comsol programming
manual or as exported from the Comsol front-end. Python will gracefully overlook gratuitous semicolons at the end of statements, so this approach
would even work for entire blocks of code. Keep in mind, however, that
JPype cannot perform all type conversions silently in the background.
Occasionally, when there is ambiguity in overloaded methods, you will
have to cast types explicitly. Refer to the [JPype
documentation][jpype-docs] for help.
