### Busbar

["Electrical Heating in a Busbar"][busbar] is an example model used
in the tutorial in ["Introduction to Comsol Multiphysics"][intro] and
explained there in great detail. The section "Getting the Maximum and
Minimum Temperature" demonstrates how two obtain the two temperature
extremes within the Comsol GUI.

The following Python code does the same thing programmatically:
```python
import mph

client = mph.start()
model = client.load('busbar.mph')
model.solve()

(x, y, z, T) = model.evaluate(['x', 'y', 'z', 'T'])
(Tmax, Tmin) = (T.max(), T.min())
(imax, imin) = (T.argmax(), T.argmin())
print(f'Tmax = {T.max():.2f} K at ({x[imax]:5f}, {y[imax]:5f}, {z[imax]:5f})')
print(f'Tmin = {T.min():.2f} K at ({x[imin]:5f}, {y[imin]:5f}, {z[imin]:5f})')
```

This outputs the exact same numbers that appear in the table of the GUI:
```none
Tmax = 330.42 K at (0.105000, -0.024899, 0.053425)
Tmin = 322.41 K at (0.063272, 0.000000, 0.000000)
```

You could now sweep the model's parameters, for example the length `L`
or width `wbb` of the busbar.

### Compacting models

We usually save models to disk after we have solved them, which
includes the solution and mesh data in the file. This is convenient
so that we can come back to the model later, but don't have to run
the simulation again, which may take a long time. However, the files
then require a lot of disk space. After a while, we may want to archive
the models, but trim the fat before we do that.

To compact all model files in the current working directory, we can
do this:
```python
import mph
from pathlib import Path

client = mph.start()
for file in Path.cwd().glob('*.mph'):
    print(f'{file}:')
    model = client.load(file)
    model.clear()
    model.save()
```

The script `compact_models.py` in the ["demos" folder][demos] of the
source-code repository is a refined version of the above code. It
displays more status information and also resets the modeling history.

Note that we could easily go through all sub-directories recursively
by replacing `glob` with `rglob`. However, this should be used with
caution so as to not accidentally modify models in folders that were
not meant to be included.

### Multiple processes

As explained in [Limitations](limitations), we cannot run more than
one Comsol session inside the same Python process. But we *can* start
multiple Python processes in parallel, thanks to the
[multiprocessing][multi] module that is part of the standard library.

So, other than MPh itself, we are going to need `multiprocessing`,
as well as `queue`, also from the standard library, though only for
the `queue.Empty` exception type that it provides.
```python
import mph
import multiprocessing
import queue
```

In this demonstration, we will solve the model `capacitor.mph` from the
["tests" folder][tests] of the source-code repository, the same model
we used in the [Tutorial](tutorial). We want to sweep the electrode
distance d and calculate the capacitance C for each value of the
distance, ranging from 0.5 to 5 mm.
```python
values = [0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0]
```

Next, we define the function that we intend to run in every process,
i.e. the "worker". The function sets up the Comsol session when the
process starts, then keeps solving the model for every distance value
that it receives via a `jobs` queue. Each time, it evaluates the
solution and returns the capacitance via a `results` queue. It does
so until the `jobs` queue is exhausted, upon which the function
terminates, and with it Comsol session and Python process.
```python
def worker(jobs, results):
    client = mph.start(cores=1)
    model = client.load('capacitor.mph')
    while True:
        try:
            d = jobs.get(block=False)
        except queue.Empty:
            break
        model.parameter('d', f'{d} [mm]')
        model.solve('static')
        C = model.evaluate('2*es.intWe/U^2', 'pF')
        results.put((d, C))
```

Each worker will only use one of the processor cores available on the
machine, as that's the whole point: We want to achieve maximum speed-up
of, say, a parameter sweep, by having each core work on a job
corresponding to one of the many parameter values, which it can do
independently of work being done for any other value.

We could also solve this sequentially, one parameter value at a time.
Comsol's solver could then make use of all cores and would also employ
some kind of parallelization in its internal computation. But the
speed-up would not scale linearly with the number of cores, especially
for large numbers of them.

We might use a "parametric sweep", a feature that Comsol does offer.
But by doing this in Python we retain full programmatic control of
which parameter is solved for and when. The parameter values don't
have to be hard-coded, they could come from user input or be generated
depending on the outcome of previous simulations. For example, this
approach lends itself to iterative optimization schemes such as the
"genetic algorithm", where a batch of simulations would be run for
each new "generation".

Note how the returned results also contain the input parameter. As
the worker processes will run asynchronously in parallel, we cannot
take for granted that output is returned in input order.

Before we start the computation, we add all parameter values to the
`jobs` queue:
```python
jobs = multiprocessing.Queue()
values = [0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0]
for d in values:
    jobs.put(d)
```

We also have to provide the `results` queue, which is of course empty
at first.
```python
results = multiprocessing.Queue()
```

Then we can start a number of workers, say four:
```python
for _ in range(4):
    process = multiprocessing.Process(target=worker, args=(jobs, results)
    process.start()
```

It may be a good idea to hold on to the `process` objects and add them
to a list `processes`, just so that Python's garbage collection won't
accidentally delete them while the external processes are running.

Finally, still in the main process that starts all the workers, we can
collect the results. We use a `for` loop and exploit the fact that
there will be as many results as there were jobs to begin with.
```python
for _ in values:
    (d, C) = results.get()
```

We would then display them, plot them, save them to a file, or whatever
it is we do with simulation results.

The complete script `worker_pool.py`, which implements all of the above
and also irons out some wrinkles not covered here for the sake of
brevity, can be found in the ["demos" folder][demos] of the source-code
repository. As it runs, it displays a live plot such as the one that
follows. It is reproduced here preserving the real time from a run with
two workers. Observe how the first two data points do in fact come in
out of order.

A more advanced implementation may use a class derived from `multiprocessing.Process` instead of a mere function, just to be able
so save state. For long-running simulations it would make sense to
store jobs and results on disk, rather than in memory, so that the
execution of the queue may be resumed after a possible interruption.
In that case, one may, or may not, find the [subprocess][subpr]
module more convenient for starting the external processes. The
worker implementation would then be in a separate module that is run
as a script.

### Creating models

While it is not the primary focus of MPh to create model features
and change settings, it is however possible — thanks to [JPype][jpype],
the Python-to-Java bridge that underpins MPh. All credit to the
JPype developers for making this possible.

Let's take this Comsol blog entry as an example: [Automate Your
Modeling Tasks with the Comsol API for use with Java][blog]. It starts
with the following Java code example:
```java
import com.comsol.model.*;
import com.comsol.model.util.*;

public class HelloWorld {

   public static void main(String[] args) {
      run();
   }

   public static Model run() {
      Model model = ModelUtil.create("Model");
      model.modelNode().create("comp1");
      model.geom().create("geom1", 3);
      model.geom("geom1").feature().create("blk1", "Block");
      model.geom("geom1").feature("blk1").set("size", new String[]{"0.1", "0.2", "0.5"});
      model.geom("geom1").run("fin");
      return model;
   }
}
```

What it does is, it creates a model, which contains a 3d geometry
component that is just a block 0.1 by 0.2 by 0.5 meters in size.

In Python, we would achieve the same with the code that follows. It
uses the `.java` attribute of the Python wrapper to access the model's
Java API directly.
```python
import mph

client = mph.start()
pymodel = client.create('model')
model = pymodel.java

model.modelNode().create("comp1");
model.geom().create("geom1", 3);
model.geom("geom1").feature().create("blk1", "Block");
model.geom("geom1").feature("blk1").set("size", ["0.1", "0.2", "0.5"]);
model.geom("geom1").run("fin");
```

Note how the *functional* Java code (excluding syntax sugar) was
essentially copied and pasted, even the semicolons, which Python
simply ignores. We had to replace `new String[]{"0.1", "0.2", "0.5"}`
because Python does not know what `new` means. There, Java expects a
list of three strings. So we replaced the expression with
`["0.1", "0.2", "0.5"]`, the Python equivalent of just that: a list
of these three strings.

Occasionally, when translating Java (or Matlab) code you find in the
documentation — or a blog entry, as the case was here —, you will have
to amend code lines such as the one above. But they are few and far
between. And the error messages you might receive would point you in
the right direction.

The upside of using the Python interface is:
* You don't really need to know Java. Just a little, to understand that
occasionally we have to take care of type conversions that JPype cannot
handle all by itself. Which is rare.
* You don't need to install Java. It just ships with Comsol. You also
don't need to bother with compiling Java source code to Java classes
via `comsolcompile`.
* You can use Python introspection to understand how Comsol models
are "created in code". This may be the most productive feature. The
Comsol documentation explains a lot of things, but not every little
detail. The function `mph.inspect()` makes introspection even easier,
as it formats the output more nicely than Python's built-in `dir()`.

Finally, to save the model created in the above example, we can just
do this:
```python
pymodel.save('model')
```

This stores a file named `model.mph` in the working directory, which
we can then open in the Comsol GUI or use in any other Python, Java,
or Matlab project.
