"""
Tests reading and writing back all node properties in the demo model.

This test is already part of the test suite, but is replicated here
in case something fails. The script can then be run with
`python -i test_rewrite.py` to drop onto the interactive prompt and
figure out when went wrong with the last property.

The script displays a count of how many properties have been tested
successfully. There are a little over 4300 properties total defined
in the demo model.

The test runs much faster in stand-alone mode, the default on Windows,
where it completes in about 10 seconds. In client-server mode, the
default on Linux and macOS, it takes much longer, like 5 *minutes*.
This points to some inefficiency in the implementation of client–server
communication and serialization (passing objects back and forth),
something that MPh has no control over.
